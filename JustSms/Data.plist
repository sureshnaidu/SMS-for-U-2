			<string>Life starts INTENSE,But Ends with SILENSE.Love starts with FEAR,Buts ends with TEARS.And Friendship starts HOWEVER,Will always Remain FOREVER.</string>

			<string>I met U as a stranger,I leave U as a friend,as long as the world stands,our friendship will never ends.All friends never splitNeven if they do they willmeet again.</string>
			<string>Wat u see as truth wat u see as liesremember that true friendship never diesalthough we may change &amp; drift apart,I will always value u deep within my heart!</string>
			<string>The hardest part ofmissing friendsis not their absence,it’s when you thinkof all those good timesand ask yourself,‘will those moments everhappen again?</string>
			<string>A FaCT :When you are up in life,Your friends get to know who you are.ButWhen you are down in life,You get to know who your friends are…</string>
			<string>What is a friend?He looks out for you,inspires you,laughs with you,cries with you,understands you,guides you and walks with you.That’s what a friend is.</string>
			<string>Few Relations in Earth Never Die.Want 2 know What it is? Read again.. (F)few (R)relations (I)in (E)earth (N)never (D)die</string>
			<string>A special friend is rare indeed, it beems to be special breed, yes, perfect friends r very few, so lucky I m for having you.</string>
			<string>If u r a chocolate ur the sweetest, if u r a Teddy Bear u r the most huggable, If u are a Star u r the Brightest, and since u r my &quot;FRIEND&quot; u r the &quot;BEST&quot;!!!!!!!!!</string>
			<string>A friend gives hope when life is low, a friend is a place when you have nowhere to go, a friend is honest, a friend is true. A friend is precious a friend is u.</string>
			<string>Science has proved that sugar melts in water,so plz don`t walk in the rain,otherwise I may lose a sweet friend like u!!!</string>
			<string>Good FRIENDS are hard to find,harder to leave,and impossible to forget.</string>
			<string>Friendship improves happiness and abates misery, by the doubling of our joy and the dividing of our grief.</string>
			<string>Its not an achievement tomake 1000’s friends in a year,but an achievement is whenyou make a friend for 1000’s years.</string>
			<string>Friendship is a Golden ChainBetween 2 Hearts.Sharing 8 Feelings.+Love+Sad+Happy+Truth+Faith+Secret+Help+Feelings…=Friendship</string>
			<string>Friendship and Love are medicinefor any kind of painbutbe sure that there is no medicinein the worldfor pain given by Love and Friendship.</string>
			<string>This is a friendship bridgewhen you are sad and lonelyjust cross this bridgeon the other side of this bridgealways and all the tie I am waiting for you.</string>
			<string>My friendship is nothing but a round,Wandering why?Because it has no end:)</string>
			<string>F R I E N D SAre LikeQ U I L T SLives Pieced Together ,Stitched With Memories ,AndBound By Love</string>
			<string>The importance of good n sincere friendshipin our lives is likethe importance of heartbeatsthey are not visiblebutthey silently support our life</string>
			<string>A coin is easy to earn, a friend is hard to find.The coin depreciates but a friend appreciates.I lost a coin when I texted you,but it’s okay because I got you.</string>
			<string>Loveless life is like a fruitless treeBut friendless life is like a rootless treeTree can live without fruitbutnot without roots</string>
			<string>Friendship is not about finding similarities, it is about respecting differences. You are not my friend coz you are like me, but because i accept you and respect you the way you are.</string>
			<string>Thank you for touching my life in ways you may never know. My riches do not lie in material wealth, but in having friend like you - a precious gift from God.</string>
			<string>Stars has 5 ends 
Square has 4 ends 
Trinagle has 3 ends 
Line has 2 ends 
but Circle of our friendship has no end...</string>
			<string>Being a friend is not just sharing a joke, a conversation, a cup of coffee or a funny story. It means sharing an honest and true part of yourself.</string>
			<string> In this cruel world it is very difficult to find friend with beautiful heart, pure feelings, attractive personality &amp; stylish looks. So learn to value me! </string>
			<string>When I was born, GOD said, &quot;Oh No! Another IDIOT&quot;. When you were born, GOD said, &quot;OH No! COMPETITION&quot;. Who knew, one day these two will become FREINDS FOREVER!</string>
			<string> Sometimes in life we think we don&apos;t need anyone. But sometime we don&apos;t have anyone when we need... So don&apos;t let your best buddies go ever...</string>
			<string>We met it was Luck! We talked it was CHANCE! We became friends it was DESTINY! We are still friends it is FAITH! We will always be friends its a PROMISE!</string>
			<string> When does a friend become a best friend? 
When his dialouge, &quot;I care for you&quot; converts into &quot;I will kill you if you don&apos;t care for me&quot;</string>
			<string>The one who likes you most, sometimes hurts you, but again he is the only one who feels your pain.</string>
			<string>For me U r as... Chees 4 pizza.. passport 4 visa... butter 4 bread.. ice 4 freezer.. cream 4 cake... water 4 lake.. leaf 4 tree.. a FRIEND like u is 4 ever 4 me..!!</string>
			<string>Friends are like shoes, some loose some tight, some fit just right, they help u as u walk through life. thanks for being my size! </string>
			<string> F: FIELD of LOVE!..R: ROOT ofJOy!.. I: ISLAND of GOD!.. E: END of SoRROW!.. N: NAME of HOPE!.. D: DOOR of UNDERSTANDING! dats YOU my FRIEND..</string>
			<string>Science has proved that sugar melts in water,so plz don`t walk in the rain, 
otherwise I may lose a sweet friend like u!!!</string>
			<string> A deep friend is like rainbow, when the perfect amount of happiness and tears r mixed, the result is a colorful bridge between 2 hearts.</string>
			<string>KeEping a FRIEND is As Difficult AS losing one. U sacrifice A lot To keep them. I may not have sacrificed enuf 4 u... but in my HEART I swear I&apos;m keeping U.. </string>
			<string>As long as we have memories, yesterday remains; as long as we have hope, tomorrow awaits. As long as we have Friendship, each day is never a waste.</string>
			<string>Its not an achievement to make 1000&apos;s friends in a year, but an achievement is when you make a friend for 1000&apos;s years.</string>
			<string> To live a life i need heartbeat, 2 have heartbeat i need a heart, 2 have heart i need happiness, to have happiness i need a friend, and 4 a friend i need U.ALWAYS</string>
			<string> Moon said to me, if ur friend is not messaging u why dont you leave ur friend.I looked at moon and said does ur sky ever leave u when u dont shine.</string>

		<array>
			<string>Love knows no reason,love knows no lies.Love defies all reasons,love has no eyes.But love is not blind,love sees but doesn’t mind.</string>
			<string>Life is very short,so break silly rules.Forgive quickly,Believe slowly,Love truly,Laugh loudly &amp;Never avoid anything that makes you smile..</string>
			<string>you can show love 2 everyone butu can show anger to only who is close 2 U,so &quot;anger&quot; is always higher &quot;love&quot;..</string>
			<string>I hope dat u finally undrstand,dat I will luv u until d end,bcoz ur not just my girl,u r also my best frnd!</string>
			<string>Without Love -- dayz are&quot;Sadday, moanday, tearsday,wasteday,thirstday,frightday,shatterday... so be in Luv everyday...</string>
			<string>Life ends when you stop dreaming, hope ends when you stop believing and love ends when you stop caring. So dream hope and love...Makes Life Beautiful.</string>
			<string>When time comes for u to give ur heart to someone, make sure u select someone who will never break ur heart, cuz broken hearts has never spare parts.</string>

			<string>Time will always fly, but our love will never die. Keep in touch and remeber me</string>
			<string>If 10 people care 4 u, one of them is me, if 1 person cares 4 u that would be me again, if no 1 cares 4 u that means i m not in this world.</string>

			<string>I love all the stars in the sky, but they are nothing compared to the ones in your eyes!</string>
			<string>I am in hospital now. After 5 minutes, I will be transferred to a surgery room. The doctor told me, I will die if I stop RECEIVING YOUR SMS.</string>
			<string>If you fall in river there is a boat .. if you fall in well there is rope .. but if you fall in love there is no hope</string>
			<string>If U delete this message thats bcoz u love me. .. If u save it thats bcoz u desire me.. &amp; if u ignore it thats bcoz u miss me. So what u gonna do with It?</string>
			<string>Do you believe in love at first sight .. or do I have to walk by again??</string>
			<string>Love is sweet poison: .. Do not consume without your beloved&apos;s advise .. and keep out of reach of children .. and keep it in cool and dark place.</string>
			<string>You are like the sunshine so warm, you are like sugar, so sweet... you are like you... and that&apos;s the reason why I love you!</string>
			<string>If you love someone, put their name in a circle, instead of a heart, because hearts can break, but circles go on forever</string>
			<string>L O V E .. L = Lake of Sorrows .. O = Ocean of Tears .. V = Valley of Death .. E = End of life....</string>
			<string>You must be a good runner because you arealways running in my mind, you must be a good thief because you have stolen my heart, and i am always a bad shooter because I Miss You Always...</string>
			<string>I have the &quot;I&quot;,I have the &quot;L&quot;,I have the &quot;O&quot;,I have the &quot;V&quot;,I have the &quot;E&quot;,... so pls can I have &quot;U&quot;?</string>
			<string>What I feel for you,is really true. You got to know,I need you so. When you are gone,I can&apos;t go on. Can&apos;t you see, that you are the only one for me?</string>
			<string>Love is like a golden chain that links our hearts together and if you ever break that chain youll break my heart 4ever!</string>

			<string>My love that shall not die, till the sun grows cold, and the stars grow old</string>
			<string>Love is like swallowing hot chocolate, it takes you by surprise at firts, but keeps you warm for a long time</string>
			<string>My love for you is a journey, starting at forever and ending at never</string>
			<string>Dont give password of our Love and friendship to anybody,Because if u will say this password &quot;I LOVE U&quot; It means he will hack u from me and u will go out from my hands.</string>
			<string> Don&apos;t wait until it&apos;s too late to tell someone how much you love, how much you care. Because when they&apos;re gone, no matter how loud you shout and cry, they won&apos;t hear you anymore.</string>
			<string>Love isn&apos;t a decision, it&apos;s a feeling. If we could decide who to love, then, life would be much simpler, but then less magical.</string>
			<string>When i look at you, 
i cannot deny there is God, 
cause only God could have created some one 
as wonderful n beautiful as you </string>

			<string>hi friends, i bet that these r the best u&apos;ld have seen in ur life. read and send it to ur frnds and make them feel hw much u miss them.</string>
			<string>Flowers need sunshine, violets need dew, all angels in heaven know I need u. years may fly, tears may dry, but my friendship with u will never die.</string>
			<string>One day u will ask me: What is more important to you, me or your life? I will say: my LIFE¦ You will walk away from me without knowing that U R MY LIFE!!!</string>

			<string>A friend is sweet when its newÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚Å¡Ã‚ÂÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦.but it is sweeter when its TRUE! But u know what? Its sweetest when its you.</string>
			<string>A friend gives hope when life is low, a friend is a place when you have nowhere to go, a friend is honest, a friend is true. A friend is precious a friend is u.</string>
			<string>If kisses were water, I will give u sea. If hugs were leaves, I will give u a tree.If u luv a planet, I will give u a galaxy, if friendship is life I will give u mine.</string>

			<string>It takes half our life to find true friends &amp; half of it keeping them.I am lucky to have spent less than half my life finding you &amp; wish to spend the rest keeping you.</string>

No Matter Who I Am Thinking,
My Heart Will Always And

			<string>If the person you love saying let’s be just friends is like a kidnapper saying let’s stay in touch !!</string>
			<string>You can&apos;t always make people respect your time. But you can always choose how to react to other people&apos;s behavior.
</string>
			<string>When someone laughs too much even on trivial things, in fact this is a sign of sadness! it indicates that person is very sad deep inside!!</string>
			<string>Just because we cry doesn’t mean we are weak, its because we’ve been strong for too long.</string>
			<string>You can never find the right person.
If U never let go of the wrong 1.
</string>
			<string>Fish 2 sea:
you can’t see my tears! because i’m part of you
Sea answered:
but i can feel it because you are actually in Me !!!</string>
			<string>Loneliness has taught me everything in this world except one thing .... how to forget the one who made me L O N E L Y.</string>
			<string>The worst regret is not for the things we did wrong but for the countless right things we did for the wrong people!!</string>
			<string>If you spend too much time holding on to the one who treats you like an option, then you will miss your chance to find the one who treats you like priority</string>

		<key>Angry</key>
		<array>
			<string>ANGER is just one letter away from D(ANGER).So, have patience in all circumstances..!That will help us to avoid all problems…!</string>
			<string>As heat conserved is transmitted into energy, so can anger controlled can be transmitted into a power which can move the world.“Reflection Cannot be seen in Boiling Water, The same way Truth cannot be seen in a state of Anger…So always keep your cool.”</string>
			<string>Don’t Misunderstand The Person Who Shows Anger On You,Because Anger Is The Most Easiest&amp; Childish Way To Express The Deep Love!</string>
			<string>If you kick a stone in anger, you’ll hurt your own foot.</string>
			<string>I feel the anger rise up in me.The same anger that makes me bleed inside In my heart and in my soul killing me.</string>
			<string>Holding on to anger, resentment and hurt only gives you tense muscles, a headache and a sore jaw from clenching your teeth. Forgiveness gives you back the laughter and the lightness in your life.</string>
			<string>If you do not wish to be prone to anger, do not feed the habit; give it nothing which may tend to its increase.</string>
			<string>If You Are Angry with your Love able Friend,Just Put aside you Egos.Just Hug Each Other and Say:I Need You Idiot, at least to Fight With Me..</string>
			<string>Events will take their course, it is no good of being angry at them; he is happiest who wisely turns them to the best account.</string>
			<string>Sometimes when I’m angry I have the right to be angry,but that doesn’t give me the right to be cruel.</string>
			<string>Anger is a killing thing: it kills the man who angers, for each rage leaves him less than he had been before – it takes something from him.</string>
			<string>Never get angry. Never make a threat. Talk politely with people.</string>
			<string>Silence is the fence around wisdom!!If your foot slips,You can always regain your balance..But if your tongue slips,You can never recall the words…So think before saying anything in anger.</string>
			<string>If you would cure anger, do not feed it. Say to yourself: ‘I used to be angry every day; then every other day; now only every third or fourth day.’ When you reach thirty days offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the gods.</string>
			<string>Always write angry letters to your enemies.But Never mail them.</string>
			<string>Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.</string>
			<string>Anger makes you smaller, while forgiveness forces you to grow beyond what you were.</string>
			<string>Usually when people are sad, they don’t do anything. They just cry over their condition. But when they get angry, they bring about a change.</string>
			<string>If you are patient in one moment of anger,you will escape a hundred days of sorrow.</string>
			<string>You SHOULDN’T OPEN UR MOUTH IN TWo SITUATIONS?ONCE WHILE SWIMMING AND THE OTHER WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY?</string>
			<string>Forgive u again?For all those times you made me cry?For all those things you said about me?For all those crap you started?For stabbing me in the back?Not Won’t 4give You,Not This TimeI am too angry with you……..</string>
			<string>The worst-tempered people I’ve ever met were people who knew they were wrong.</string>
			<string>Not the fastest horse can catch a word spoken in anger.</string>
			<string>ANGER Comes AloneBut TAKES AWAY all the GOODQualities FROM Us.PATIENCE Too Comes Alone,ButBRINGS All the GOOD Qualities To Us.So Be with It….</string>
			<string>A Single Harsh Word SpokenAt The Time Of Anger Is So PoisonousThat It Makes Us To forget The100 Lovable Conversations Within Seconds.Never get angry,be Happy always!!!</string>
			<string>“Anger is the only evil which makes love invisible for a minute.And love is the only suspicious thing which is visible even after anger.</string>
			<string>Sorry there is no space for your msg in my inbox and also no space for you in my heart.I am very angry with you…..</string>
			<string>Do something that makes a difference because by God,there’s a lot to make you angry.</string>
			<string>Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret.</string>
			<string>Anyone can become angry that is easy but to be angry with the right person at the right time, and for the right purpose and in the right way that is not within everyone’s power and that is not easy.</string>
			<string>ANGER is an acid that does more harm to the vessel in which it is stored,that to anything on which it is poured.</string>
			<string>Anger is the feeling that makes your mouth work faster than your mind.</string>
			<string>It is impossible for you to be angry and laugh at the same time. Anger and laughter are mutually exclusive and you have the power to choose either.</string>
			<string>Love is like giving Gun 2 some1having it pointed @ ur HeartTrusting them to never pull d triggerbut sadly most of d time they do it.!!</string>
